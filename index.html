            <p>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.It is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.</p>
            <p>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.</p>

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience in any language will be helpful.</li>
            </ul></p>

            <header>C++</header>
            <p>C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
                C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
            </p>
            <p>C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
                As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.  
            </p>
            <p><strong>A sample program:</strong></p>
            <code>
                #include <iostream> <br> 
                    using namespace std; <br>

                    int main() {<br>
                      cout << "Hello World!";<br>
                      return 0;<br>
                    }<br>
                    
            </code>

         <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <br>
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C++ has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.</p>
            <p>The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C++ is case-sensitive.</p>
            <p>There are following basic types of variable in C++ </p>
            <ol>
                <li>bool - Stores either value true or false.</li>
                <li>char - Typically a single octet (one byte). This is an integer type.</li>
                <li>int - The most natural size of integer for the machine.</li>
                <li>float - A single-precision floating point value.</li>
                <li>double - A double-precision floating point value.</li>
                <li>void - Represents the absence of type.</li>
                <li>string - A string type</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong> Some valid declarations are shown here −</strong></p>
            <code>
                int    i, j, k; <br>
                char   c, ch;<br>
                float  f, salary;<br>
                double d; <br>
                <br>
            </code>
         </section>
         <section class="main-section" id="Scope">
            <br>
            <header>Scope</header>
            <p>In general, the scope is defined as the extent up to which something can be worked with. In programming also the scope of a variable is defined as the extent of the program code within which the variable can we accessed or declared or worked with.</p>
            <p>There are mainly two types of variable scopes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><i>Local Scope</i>- Variables defined within a function or block are said to be local to those functions.</li>
                <li><i>Global scope</i>- Global Variables can be accessed from any part of the program. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Sample Code:</p>
            <code>
                #include<iostream><br>
                using namespace std;<br>
                //global variable<br>
                int global=5;<br>
                //main function<br>
                int main(){<br>
                    //local variable<br>
                    int local=2;<br>
                }<br>
                <br>
            </code>

            <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.</p>
            <p>Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</p>
            <p>The C++ standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, function strcat() to concatenate two strings, function memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location and many more functions.</p>

            <header>Condition-Statements</header>
            <p>Conditional statements, also known as selection statements, are used to make decisions based on a given condition. If the condition evaluates to True, a set of statements is executed, otherwise another set of statements is executed.</p>
            <p>The if Statement: The if statement selects and executes the statement(s) based on a given condition. If the condition evaluates to True then a given set of statement(s) is executed. However, if the condition evaluates to False, then the given set of statements is skipped and the program control passes to the statemen.</p>
            <p>The if-else Statement: The if – else statement causes one of the two possible statement( s) to execute, depending upon the outcome of the condition</p>   
            <code>
                if (condition) {<br>
                    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true<br>
                  }  <br>
                else if (condition) { <br>
                    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true<br>
                }<br>
                else{<br>
                    // block of code to be executed if the condition is false<br>
